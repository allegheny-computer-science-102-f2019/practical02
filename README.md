Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the starter files for Practical 2 in Computer Science 102.

## Introduction

This assignment requires a programmer to reassemble a program that calculates factorials. A carefully formatted assignment sheet for this project provides more details about the steps that a programmer should take to complete this assignment. You can view this assignment sheet by visiting the listing of laboratories on the course web site.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
